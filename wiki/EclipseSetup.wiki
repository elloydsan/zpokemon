This is a simple tutorial on how to get started with the ZPokemon client and server.

==Step 1 - SVN Checkout:==
First you must checkout the SVN onto your computer. You must have a SVN client installed on your computer for this to work. You can download TortoiseSVN from here: http://tortoisesvn.net/

 * Create a folder on your desktop or desired location
 * Right click on the folder and select SVN checkout
 * In the Checkout screen fill in the URL of repository as:    http://zpokemon.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

==Step 2 - Create Projects:==
Next you must create the eclipse projects.

 * Open eclipse and select *File->new Java Project*
 * Enter in the project name of *zpokemon*
 * Select finish
 * Repeat the steps again but this time make the project *zpokemon_server*

==Step 3 - Copy code to eclipse:==
And finally we have to copy the source files into our project.

 * Open up the SVN folder you checked out
 * Drag the contents of client into *zpokemon's src* folder
 * Repeat for the server
